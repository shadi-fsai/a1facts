## Query Processing Flow

![Query Processing Flow](diagrams/query_processing_flow.png)

## Live Query Example

**Business Question**: "What cardiovascular safety data exists for our top 3 GLP-1 competitors?"

**System Response** (captured from actual API calls):
```
Agent Session: 6bfe60d1-1e0c-4cc7-a415-3c75f1aea3cd
Processing Time: 3.26 seconds
Token Usage: 837 input, 96 output

Knowledge Graph Queries:
- Maridebart cafraglutide cardiovascular adverse events
- VK2735 cardiovascular adverse events  
- Pemvidutide cardiovascular adverse events

API Acquisitions:
- FDA FAERS: No cardiovascular adverse events reported
- ClinicalTrials.gov: Active trials with cardiovascular endpoints
- Data Sources: FDA API, NCT05989711, NCT05669599
```

### Competitive Intelligence Output

| Drug | Company | CV Safety Status | Last Endpoint Report |
|------|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| MariTide | Amgen | No CV events in FDA database | June 23, 2025 |
| VK2735 | Viking | No CV events in FDA database | August 19, 2025 |
| Pemvidutide | Altimmune | No CV events in FDA database | June 26, 2025 |

**Business Insight**: Clean cardiovascular safety profiles across all three competitors suggest this drug class maintains favorable risk profile for regulatory approval.
